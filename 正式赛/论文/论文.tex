\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Restatement}
Considering that the carbon dioxide can be sequestered in both forests 
and wooden products, it's reasonable that more carbon will be stored by forests with the 
appropriate combination of the regrowth of younger forests and the wooden products.
Thus, forest managers are ought to deliberate about the balance between the value of forests 
as living tress to grow and absorb the carbon and the value of forests harvested as wooden products.
What's more, the forest managers should not only consider the factors about forests such as 
type and age of forests, geography, topography, and benefits and lifespan of forest products,
but also the conservation and diversity of wild species, recreational uses and cultural considerations.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [1.] Design a carbon sequestration model to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide 
    sequestered by a forest and its products, which also determines what kind of manage plan is
    most efficient at sequestering carbon.
    \item [2.] Develop a decision model consisting of various ways that forests are valued (including
    carbon sequestration) for forest managers to understand the best use of a forest. Consider 
    the following questions. What is the scope of the management plan that your decision model might suggest?
    Are there any conditions that the forests should not be harvested?
    Whether there is a transition point between management plans applicable to all forests?
    How can the characteristics of a particular forest and its location be used 
    to determine transition points between management plans?
    \item [3.] Apply your models to various forests. Identify a forest that your decision model 
    would suggest the inclusion of harvesting in its management plan.
    How much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by this forest and its products in 100 years?
    What kind of forest management plan should be carried out for this forest? Why it's best?
    The best management plan is assumed to include a harvest interval of 10 
    years longer than current forest practices discussing strategies for transitioning 
    from existing to new schedules in a manner sensitive to the needs of forest managers 
    and all those who use forests.

    \item [4.] Some people think that we should never cut down any trees, but you've
    determined the forest which includes harvest in its management. Write a one-to-two-page
    non-technical newspaper articles to explain why your analysis including in the 
    management of the forest logging, rather than it remaining the same. Finally, your ariticle 
    should convince local community that it's the best decision for their forest.

\section{Model I}
\subsection{Cellular Automata based Population Size Prediction}

Cellular automata (CA) is a kind of grid dynamics model with discrete time, 
space and state, and local spatial interaction and temporal causality, which 
has the ability to simulate the space-time evolution process of complex system.
\par
Unlike general dynamical models, cellular automata are not determined by strictly 
defined physical equations or functions, but are composed of rules constructed by 
a series of models. Any model that satisfies these rules can be regarded as a cellular 
automata model. Therefore, cellular automata is a general term for a class of models, 
or a method framework. Its characteristic is that time, space and state are discrete, 
each variable only takes a finite number of states, and its state change rules are local 
in time and space.
\par
The block diagram of a typical cellular automata is shown in Figure \ref{CA_Fig}, 
and the simulation result is shown in Figure \ref{CA_Result}, in which
we learn that the under the natural circumstances, the forestry population size
will reach and remain around 2100 per hectare.

\subsection{Binary Timber Volume and Logistic based Carbon Sequestration Model}

In order to clearly demonstrate the amount of carbon sequestered by forests and their
products, we decide to consider the trunk volume of living trees as an estimation of 
total Volume of trees that are able to store carbon \citep{WangYan}. 
\par
For the living trees, we apply Binary Timber Volume Regression model \citep{LuoQingbang} 
to depict their growth as shown in Algorithm \ref{Binary Volume Algo}. 
It is significant
to point out that $ \beta_b $ and $ \beta_c $ are two \textbf{Conversion Factors} from
Timber Volume to Carbon Mass sequestered. Besides, the mass of carbon sequestered in
soil and leaves can be deemed as a constant which merely depends on the area
of coniferous and broad-leaved forests \citep{YanDeren2011}. 
\par
As for the wooden products, we consider $ w $ kinds of wooden products, each kind,
which decomposes at the rate of $ m_i (i = 1,\cdots, w) $, accounts for $ \phi_i$ 
of the total product mass \citep{2006Forest}. Note that the \textbf{harvest rate} $ \lambda $ and the product
proportion $ \phi $ are flexible regarding the circumstances, which are also 
the core of our forest management. What's more, we hold the view that 
the volume of wooden products derive from the volume of harvested trees with a certain
\textbf{Scrap Rate} $ s $. The complete idea is shown in Algorithm \ref{Product Algo}.
\par
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{minipage}[htbp]{0.42\linewidth}
    The Scrap Rate is determined as following descriptions, which is also shown 
    in Figure \ref{RoundWood} on the right. There are two 
    manufacturing methods of Round Wood harvested from the forests. 
    \par
    One way is to trim the wood neatly into slabs in different shapes so that they can
    occupy most of the volume of the wood, which will be processed into softwood plywood, 
    panels and board. Meanwhile, the scrap will be manufactured into miscellaneous 
    products. It can approach the utilization rate of 81.3\%.
    \par
    The other kind of craft is to separate the bark and turn it into paper, and 
    the separated log can be processed into softwood and hardwood. The utilization 
    rate of this craft is able to reach almost 100\%.

We apply our model over a hypothetic forestry land with 10000 hectares, in which
the broad leaf trees takes one half and the other half is coniferous trees. Two
primary decision factors, which are harvest rate and product proportion,
are discussed by conducting sensitivity test. 
\par
The sensitivity test of Harvest Rate is conducted by calculating the Carbon Dioxide
sequestered by the living trees and the wooden products every 1\% of 
harvest rate from 1\% to 30\%, which can be seen in Figure \ref{Harvest Rate sensTest}.
\par
The sensitivity test of Product Proportion is carried out by determining the 
Carbon sequestered by wooden products under different types of product proportion
arrangement. The proportion of products with higher Decomposition Rate increases
from Type 1 to Type 5, which means in Type 5, most of the wood is consumed to manufacture
high Decomposition Rate products. The result is shown in Figure \ref{Product Proportion sensTest}.

\section{Model II}

In order to comprehensively consider the multiple social interests, we add
several indexes which can fully demonstrate the impact of Forests over local 
society. 
\par
The indexes are divided into two aspects, namely \textbf{Carbon Sink} and \textbf{Cultural Value}.




\subsection{Carbon Sink}
Carbon Sink includes the following indexes: \textbf{Carbon Credit Benefit and 
Cost Analysis(CVal), Wooden Product Proportion, Harvest Rate} and \textbf{Interspecific 
Competition}, which will exert influence on carbon sink in this Forest.
\par
CVal is a spreadsheet tool to evaluate the direct benefits and costs of Carbon 
Sequestration contracts for managed forests developed by E.M. (Ted) Bilek,
Peter Becker and Tim McAbee. By inputting a series of parameters of the Forests
such as tract size, $ \rm{CO_2} $ sequestration rate and Carbon price, CVal will
automatically come up with Average cost of trading, Net trading benefit, 
Internal Rate of Return and other important economic indexes. 
\par
Wooden Product Proportion and Harvest Rate are fully discussed above, which will not
be repeated again.
\par
Interspecific Competition is calculated by \textbf{Lotka-Volterra Model}, which is 
used to describe ecology evolution.
Suppose there are two species competing for surviving spaces, namely
Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora, whose population sizes are $ N_1 $ and $ N_2 $, population growth rates
are $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $, carrying capacity $ K_1 $ and $ K_2 $ and coefficients of competition over each other 
are $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $. 
Thus, based on the Logistic growth model, the population of Douglas Fir
can be described as 
$$
  \frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1\cdot N_1\cdot (\frac{K_1-N_1-\alpha N_2}{K_1})
$$ 
, in which $ \alpha $ is defined as a coefficients of competition of Douglas Fir over Pinus Densiflora,
representing that each Pinus Densiflora will occupy the surviving spaces of
 $ \alpha $ Douglas Firs.
 Similarly, the population of Pinus Densiflora can be described as $$
 \frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2\cdot N_2\cdot (\frac{K_2-N_2-\alpha N_1}{K_2})
 $$ 
Thus, there are four possible results for these two kinds of trees.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item [(1)] Douglas Fir wins, and Pinus Densiflora gets sidelined;
  \item [(2)] Pinus Densiflora wins, and Douglas Fir gets sidelined;
  \item [(3)] Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora coexist stably;
  \item [(4)] Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora coexist erratically.
\end{enumerate}

Whichever wins, the intensity of intraspecific competition will decline while the
intensity of interspecific competition will roar. If both species suffer high level of
intraspecific competition as well as low interspecific competition, they will stably
coexist, otherwise it leads to unstable coexistence. 
\par
Result of the competition between Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora is shown in 
Figure \ref{Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora result}, while the thermodynamic diagram
of competition intensity between these two species can be seen in Figure \ref{Matrix Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora}.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{code&pic/Interspecies-matrix.eps}
  \caption{Thermodynamic Diagram of Competition}\label{Matrix Douglas Fir and Pinus Densiflora}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cultural Value}

\par
In order to further demonstrate the relationship between the five indexes and 
Cultural Value, we abstract three concepts, namely Biodiversity, Development of 
Forest and Forest Influence, from the indexes. The structure of indexes related to 
Cultural Value can be clearly drawn from Figure \ref{Index_CulVal}, 
in which Proportion of Forest and Size
of Forest signify the population the Forest can influence, and Volume of Deadwood
,"an element of biodiversity and, to some extent, an indicator of forest 
management sustainability that deserves to be taken into account in inventories,
especially at the national level"\citep{rondeux2010review}, along with the 
Forest Hierarchy, which provides arboreal 
animals with more habitats, determines the Biodiversity of the Forest.

\end{figure}
























\section{Sensitivity Test}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{minipage}[htbp]{0.4\linewidth}
    We assume that the density of the forest population follows the Logistic Model,
    and the \textbf{Carrying Capacity of the trees} is $ K $. From the Carbon Sequestration
    probability predicted on the right we can draw a reasonable conclusion that
    the Logistic Model will result into chaos after 3.6 rounds of harvests.
