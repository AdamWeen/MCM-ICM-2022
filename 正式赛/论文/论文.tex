\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Restatement}
In order to cope with the tremendous threat imposed by climate change, human-beings should 
spare no effort to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by not only cutting
down the emission of the greenhouse gases, but also sequestering carbon from the atmosphere into
plants, soil and water. Considering that the carbon dioxide can be sequestered in both forests 
and wooden products, it's reasonable that more carbon will be stored by forests with the 
appropriate combination of the regrowth of younger forests and the wooden products.
Thus, forest managers are ought to deliberate about the balance between the value of forests 
as living tress to grow and absorb the carbon and the value of forests harvested as wooden products.
What's more, the forest managers should not only consider the factors about forests such as 
type and age of forests, geography, topography, and benefits and lifespan of forest products,
but also the conservation and diversity of wild species, recreational uses and cultural considerations.
\par
The International Carbon Management (ICM) Collaboration has been established to guide the management
of forests all over the world under the consideration of different forest formation, climate, 
population, interests and values.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [1.] Design a carbon sequestration model to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide 
    sequestered by a forest and its products, which also determines what kind of manage plan is
    most efficient at sequestering carbon.
    \item [2.] Develop a decision model consisting of various ways that forests are valued (including
    carbon sequestration) for forest managers to understand the best use of a forest. Consider 
    the following questions as well as those of your own:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [a.] What is the scope of the management plan that your decision model might suggest?
        \item [b.] Are there any conditions that the forests should not be harvested?
        \item [c.] Whether there is a transition point between management plans applicable to all forests?
        \item [d.] How can the characteristics of a particular forest and its location be used 
        to determine transition points between management plans?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item [3.] Apply your models to various forests. Identify a forest that your decision model 
    would suggest the inclusion of harvesting in its management plan.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [a.] How much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by this forest and its products in 100 years?
        \item [b.] What kind of forest management plan should be carried out for this forest? Why it's best?
        \item [c.] The best management plan is assumed to include a harvest interval of 10 
        years longer than current forest practices discussing strategies for transitioning 
        from existing to new schedules in a manner sensitive to the needs of forest managers 
        and all those who use forests.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item [4.] Some people think that we should never cut down any trees, but you've
    determined the forest which includes harvest in its management. Write a one-to-two-page
    non-technical newspaper articles to explain why your analysis including in the 
    management of the forest logging, rather than it remaining the same. Finally, your ariticle 
    should convince local community that it's the best decision for their forest.

\section{Binary Volume and Logistic based Carbon Sequestration Model}

In order to clearly demonstrate the amount of carbon sequestered by forests and their
products, we decide to consider the trunk volume of living trees as an estimation of 
total Volume of trees that are able to store carbon \citep{WangYan}. 
\par
For the living trees, we apply Binary Timber Volume Regression model \citep{LuoQingbang} 
to depict their growth as shown in Algorithm \ref{Binary Volume Algo}. 
It is significant
to point out that $ \beta_b $ and $ \beta_c $ are two \textbf{Conversion Factors} from
Timber Volume to Carbon Mass sequestered. Besides, the mass of carbon sequestered in
soil and leaves can be deemed as a constant which merely depends on the area
of coniferous and broad-leaved forests \citep{YanDeren2011}. 
\par
As for the wooden products, we consider $ w $ kinds of wooden products, each kind,
which decomposes at the rate of $ m_i (i = 1,\cdots, w) $, accounts for $ \phi_i$ 
of the total product mass \citep{2006Forest}. Note that the \textbf{harvest rate} $ \lambda $ and the product
proportion $ \phi $ are flexible regarding the circumstances, which are also 
the core of our forest management. What's more, we hold the view that 
the volume of wooden products derive from the volume of harvested trees with a certain
\textbf{Scrap Rate} $ s $. The complete idea is shown in Algorithm \ref{Product Algo}.
\par
We assume that the density of the forest population follows the Logistic Model,

\subsection{Model III: Cellular Automata based Population Size Prediction}

Cellular automata (CA) is a kind of grid dynamics model with discrete time, 
space and state, and local spatial interaction and temporal causality, which 
has the ability to simulate the space-time evolution process of complex system.
\par
Unlike general dynamical models, cellular automata are not determined by strictly 
defined physical equations or functions, but are composed of rules constructed by 
a series of models. Any model that satisfies these rules can be regarded as a cellular 
automata model. Therefore, cellular automata is a general term for a class of models, 
or a method framework. Its characteristic is that time, space and state are discrete, 
each variable only takes a finite number of states, and its state change rules are local 
in time and space.
\par
The block diagram of a typical cellular automata is shown in Figure \ref{CA_Fig}, 
and the simulation result is shown in Figure \ref{CA_Result}, in which
we learn that the under the natural circumstances, the forestry population size
will reach and remain around 2100 per hectare.
